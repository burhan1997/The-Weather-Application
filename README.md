# The Weather Application

## Project Overview

This weather application is designed to provide users with accurate and real-time weather information. Users can access current weather conditions.

## Project Requirements

1. The app needs to be responsive.
2. The app needs to be a single page application. That means there should be only one index.html file and JavaScript needs to update the HTML using DOM manipulation.
3. The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.
4. The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API and needs to show this to the user, not just a console.log.
5. The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally with one fetch.
