# The Weather Application

## Project Overview

This weather application is designed to provide users with accurate and real-time weather information. Users can access current weather conditions. As soon as we find a location that we want it'll show us the status give us an icon as well as our wind speed, temperature and precipitation.

## Project Requirements

1. The app needs to be responsive.
2. The app needs to be a single page application. That means there should be only one index.html file and JavaScript needs to update the HTML using DOM manipulation.
3. The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.
4. The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API and needs to show this to the user, not just a console.log.
5. The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally with one fetch.


## Must-Have Features

- [x] **Current Weather Conditions:** Display real-time temperature, wind speed, and precipitation for the user's selected location.

- [ ] **Hourly and Daily Forecasts:** Provide detailed forecasts for the upcoming hours and days.

- [ ] **Location Customization:** Allow users to set and customize preferred locations for accurate weather updates.


## Nice-to-Have Features

- [ ] **Interactive Maps:** Integrate maps for users to visualize weather patterns and explore forecasts geographically.

- [ ] **Social Sharing:** Enable users to share weather updates on social media platforms.

- [ ] **Dark Mode:** Implement a visually pleasing dark mode for better user experience during low-light conditions.
